  procedure: Adversaries may use the Mimikatz tool to access the contents stored in
    the memory of the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process.
    Using the SEKURLSA::LogonPasswords module, Mimikatz attempts to obtain credential
    data by listing all available provider credentials. The module uses a Kernel32
    function called OpenProcess to obtain an identifier for LSASS. It then accesses
    LSASS and extracts the NTLM hash of currently (or recently) logged on accounts,
    as well as the credentials of services running in the user's context.

    description: Search for non-system accounts attempting to access LSASS. While
      most adversaries inject themselves into a system process to hide among the majority
      of applications accessing LSASS, there are instances when attackers use administrator
      rights instead of escalating their access to the system level, as this is the
      minimum requirement for accessing LSASS.
